A productivity solution conceptualized by one desperately in need of one. 

Our application is a calendar and task tracker application. As the name implies, the application features an optimized process to scheduling meetings. Users can share schedules where private events are kept private. Our backend consists of a customized calendar framework in Python and Firebase. The frontend is structured using Flask.
